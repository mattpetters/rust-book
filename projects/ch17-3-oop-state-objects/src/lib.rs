/*
The implementation using the state pattern is easy to extend to add more functionality.
To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state pattern, try a few of these suggestions:

Add a reject method that changes the postâ€™s state from PendingReview back to Draft.
Require two calls to approve before the state can be changed to Published.
Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the Draft state.
Hint: have the state object responsible for what might change about the content
but not responsible for modifying the Post.
