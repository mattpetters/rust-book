/*
The implementation using the state pattern is easy to extend to add more functionality.
To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state pattern, try a few of these suggestions:

Add a reject method that changes the post’s state from PendingReview back to Draft.
Require two calls to approve before the state can be changed to Published.
Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the Draft state.
Hint: have the state object responsible for what might change about the content
but not responsible for modifying the Post.
